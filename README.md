How the Script Works
----------------------
The run_analysis.R script contains functions that do the following behaviours:

1. Read the dataset
2. Merge the training and test datasets into one dataset
3. Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
4. Name the activities with descriptive activity names
5. Label the dataset with descriptive activity names
6. Creates a second tidy dataset with the mean of each variable for each activity and subject

How to Run the Script
----------------------
1. Extract the data first into working directory
2. Run the script using - source('run_analysis.R')
